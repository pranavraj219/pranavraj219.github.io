Hi!!
Pranav here.
I like to read, code, eat, cook, travel and learn.  
Currently, I am working as a Platform Engineer at Flock, Directi.  
Not a fan of watching any sports (only playing).  
I believe in practicality and discipline.  
Other hobbies include watching movies and series.  

Also, did you know that `~>` is known as a **twiddle wakka** ?
